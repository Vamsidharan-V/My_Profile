        <h2><u>PROJECTS</u></h2>
            <b><font size = 4>Roadsaftey VR</b></br>
            <ul><li>I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of a VR game aimed at educating students on road safety rules in a fun and engaging way. In total, the game had five levels.</li>
                <li>My contribution involved designing and implementing levels 3, 5, and part of level 1. It was a fulfilling experience to see this project grow and evolve into a research publication.</li>
            </ul></br><b>VR Based Moon and Spacetation</b></br>
            <ul><li>Unity software was used to create Moon and Station, designed to be interactive and appealing for exploration and instructional reasons, focusing on stimulating students ' interest in space exploration. </li>
            <li>I handled GUI interactions and translated the project from Unity3D to VR, which resulted in a research publication.</li>    
        </ul><b>AI-Assisted farming for crop recommendation & farm yield prediction application	</b>
        <ul><li>Two machine learning models were developed to assist farmers in increasing their output and profit by predicting yield and proposing the best crop</li>
            <li>IBM Watson Studio was used to create both machine-learning models. Both models have an accuracy rate of over 90%.</li>
        </ul><b>Seven wonders in virtual reality</b>
        <ul><li>A Virtual reality application is developed using Unity3D and Oculus Quest 2 to bring tourism to everyone's availability. I was responsible for developing Petra, Colosseum, and Chichen Itza. </li>       
        <li>Each stage consists of one of the seven wonders. The concept behind the project brings innovation to the field of tourism</li>
        </ul><b>AR Based jewellery application for mobile</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed an AR jewelry app using Unity for Android devices. Users can virtually try on 50 necklaces across five categories using their device's camera. </li>
            <li>Handpicked and developed 3D models using Blender with texture mapping. Responsible for manual alignment of 3D models in Unity which enhanced accuracy in the AR experience.</li>
        </ul>
